Thank you to our incredible community for your continued support of our online educational festival: On Roma Matters & Other Compelling Stories. In light of recent events, we have decided to postpone this week's workshops, as we bring our attention on the Week of Action in Defense of Black Lives. As a community focused on uplifting and amplifying the voices of Roma people and their allies, we deeply understand the need for mutual support, kinship and solidarity. We are proud to stand with our Black friends and colleagues as they make their voices heard. We envision a world where equality is not just a concept to aspire to, but is the lived experience of all people.

We would like to remind everyone that the Roma Peoples Project is hosted by the The Center for Justice at Columbia University, an incredible organization that helps end mass incarceration, a struggle that sadly affects many Black families around the country. A few years ago, they stood up for us and made space for our initiative to exist, because they understood how hard it is for an entire people's identity to be criminalized. They shared their offices and resources so we can build an infrastructure of our own. This proves that where there is a will, there is a way, and often times generosity and empathy come from those who are familiar with struggle and exclusion. Please check out their work and spotlight their efforts!

We will resume our educational festival next week, Monday June 8th at 8 am. We will be send updates on postponed seminars shortly.
