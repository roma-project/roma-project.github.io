Hi, I am Cristiana Grigore, the founder of the Roma Peoples Project at Columbia University and a Roma scholar. Our project advances Roma scholarship and spotlights Roma stories and related topics such as stigma, migration, statelessness in a global society, myths and stereotypes, all with a focus on empowering narratives of Roma and Roma allies. We work toward a world where it is not only easier to connect widely and quickly, but where we can also connect on a human level and pay attention to groups that have been previously neglected and excluded. If slogans like “We are in this together” are used to emphasize the need for equality and shared challenges, then everyone should have the chance for their potential to shine and thrive. 

My colleague Sarah Zawacki (who is also a presenter in this educational fundraising festival) and I at the Roma Peoples Project organized this initiative, because we believe that Roma Matter. And sometimes we need to show that in concrete ways. The funds raised as a result of this fundraiser are critical for the Roma Peoples Project to continue our activity. We are thrilled that so many incredible and diverse speakers have joined us for this festival and therefore share our belief that Roma matter, too! Please take a look below at their impressive backgrounds and diverse set of skills, talents and expertise. I hope you will join us for this educational experience, which we wish to be meaningful and insightful for us all!
