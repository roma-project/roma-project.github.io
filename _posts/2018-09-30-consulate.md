On October 15th, we are pleased to invite you to an event celebrating Jan Yoors' life and his love for the Roma People. The Roma Peoples Project at Columbia University in collaboration with the General Delegation of the Government of Flanders, will co-host a book launch of Hidden Tapestry: Jan Yoors, His Two Wives, and the War That Made Them One by Debra Dean. This historical biography examines the work of Flemish author and artist Jan Yoors, one of the first recognized writers to counter stereotypes of Roma with his nuanced portrayals. 

The Roma peoples, the largest ethnic minority in Europe, are a diverse group commonly known by the misnomer "Gipsy." The United States of America is home to over one million Roma, many of whom live right here in New York City. 

Please join us! 

Monday, October 15, 6.00 pm - 8.00 pm
Where: World Room, Second Floor 
Pulitzer Hall, School of Journalism, Columbia University 
2950 Broadway, New York (Between 115th - 116th and Broadway)
