# The Roma Peoples Project

The Roma Peoples Project is a start-up initiative at Columbia University that identifies and amplifies new narratives for a global Roma people. The Project creates a space for Roma and non-Roma to share innovative scholarship, narrate experiences, build community and explore the intersectional subjectivity inherent to being Roma in the 21st century.

RPP uses a Jekyll version of the "Forty" theme by [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/).
